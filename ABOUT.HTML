<center><h2><b>What is THE ROYAL STAY?</b></h2></center>
We are a metasearch engine that compares accommodation prices and offers provided to us by many different online booking sites.  We compare and display different offers from many booking sites, and they pay us a fee if a user clicks on their specific deal. We are not a party to any booking agreement between you and the site or accommodation you book with. We do not collect any payments for your stay and are not liable for the services offered by the booking site and the accommodation provider.

THE ROYAL STAY works with many booking sites worldwide, including online travel agencies, as well as accommodation chains and independent hotels. In total, THE ROYAL STAY’s sites cover more than 2.5 million hotels and other types of accommodations across approximately 190 countries.

As a hotel price comparison website, THE ROYAL STAY makes money from advertising partners primarily using a cost-per-click (CPC) business model. Booking platforms, hoteliers and other providers list rates and advertise on the THE ROYAL STAY site, paying for the clicks received from THE ROYAL STAY users.

THE ROYAL STAY also offers free and fee-based versions of its Hotel Manager product, which hoteliers use to market their facilities on the THE ROYAL STAY site. THE ROYAL STAY claims to be the world's largest online hotel search site, comparing rates from over 1 million hotels and more than 250 booking sites worldwide.[citation needed] Since their majority shareholder is Expedia, the effort is to direct bookings to their sites by way of various "adjustments" to how other sites' rates are perceived.

<CENTER><H2><B>History </H2></B></CENTER>
The company was founded in Düsseldorf, Germany, in January 2005. Seeing an opportunity in the hotel search space, the founding team developed Germany's first hotel search engine. Shortly after launch, Stephan Stubner resigned as Managing Director, but the three other founders (Rolf Schrömgens, Peter Vinnemeier and Malte Siewert) remained.

Initially, THE ROYAL STAY received €1 million from investors, including the Samwer brothers,[who?] Florian Heinemann, and Christian Vollmann. In 2007, THE ROYAL STAY received US$1.14 million in Series B funding from the British company HOWZAT media LLP. In December 2010, THE ROYAL STAY sold a quarter of the company for US$52.86 million to a US investment fund, Insight Venture Partners.
